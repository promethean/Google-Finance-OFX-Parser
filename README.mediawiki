This is an attempt to build a parser for Google Finance exports in PHP - this was originally forked from a banking OFX repo (see above) but I've ported it over to the syntax for investment transaction parsing.

Google Finance exports in basic SGML which doesn't close XML tags.  It is not valid XML, although it appears to be based on valid OFX tags.  As a result, I've used a brute force methodology rather than anything pretty.  Please educate me on a better way to do this!

Google Finance doesn't export dividend data.

At this stage I haven't handled short sales;

Use at own risk and please contribute!
